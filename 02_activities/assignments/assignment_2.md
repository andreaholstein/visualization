# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad
  - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like!
- For each visualization (good and bad):

  - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

    ```
    Bad visualization:
    https://www.flickr.com/photos/laurenmanning/5658976485/

    Reasons:
    - colour choices arbitrary, not informative, and distracting
    - font/colour contrast poor in regards to accessibility requirements
    - numeric values lack context
    - graph, in general, lacks context.

    Good visualization:
    https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mark2859/viz/KidneyTransplantsDashboard/KidneyDonationSavesLives

    Reasons:
    - data layout (hexes in the shape of the United States) immediately makes it clear where the sample population is located, especially with the states' identifiers printed on each one.
    - graph labelled very comprehensively - title could be larger, but it's very clear what the data in question is.
    - the addition of a subplot line graph to denote the larger trend behind the data visualized in purple hexes adds phenomenal context, while still allowing the punchy graphic to shine.
    - colour choice fair - contrast a bit low for the lighter shades of purple against the surrounding gray boxes - could saturate that more to emphasize those differences. Deeper purple hexes would benefit from changes the font colour from black to something higher contrast to meet accessibility standards.
    ```

  - How could this data visualization have been improved?

    ```
    Bad visualization:
    https://www.flickr.com/photos/laurenmanning/5658976485/

    Improvements:
    - font size and colour contrast need to be increased to meet accessibility standards.
    - there seems to be a lot of context missing: who consumed this food? who was sampled? what geographic region/culture does this sample belong to? Having this information would inform the viewer better about what they are looking at, and what they should be taking away from that review.
    - a treemap does not seem to be the best way to have displayed this information - a bar graph's dual axes may have forced the data visualizer to think more deeply about labelling (and thus, provide more context for the viewer).

    Good visualization:
    https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mark2859/viz/KidneyTransplantsDashboard/KidneyDonationSavesLives

    Improvements:
    - the gray boxes at the top are not immediately clear as toggles - could benefit from some labelling/a clearer call-to-action design.
    - the testimonials and Did you know boxes don't add to the visualization in any way, but as the visualization serves a clear goal (that "kidney donation saves lives"), these feed into that messaging. For a public data visualization, this makes a lot of sense; for an internal report viz, I think the graphs would benefit from their removal to present the data more objectively.

    ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e.
  300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes

* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
